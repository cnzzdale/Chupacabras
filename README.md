# Chupacabras (UtraBeta)

(Firefox OS experimental application)

Very simple example of a RSS reader.

* You add an URL
* The RSS is downloaded
* You can read it offline

## State

This is an experiment, coded in two hours fighting with technologies we never have met before, so don't expect to find clean code and good tests :)

## Using

* [App template](https://github.com/mozilla/mortar-tab-view)
* [Google RSS API](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/webmaster/how-to-work-with-rss-using-google-feed-api-and-javascript/1900)

## TODO

* Bug in localStorage: only first load is stored
* Checking for no connection so not external JS are loaded an not 'ADD RSS' button
* Design!!!
